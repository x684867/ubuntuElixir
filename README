ubuntuElixir
------------

Objectives:
    (1) To establish a uniform docker base image for Elixir based on the Ubuntu operating system from which others can develop Elixir projects for rapid deployment as Docker containers.

    (2) This docker base image is only an elixir installation.


Usage:
    To use this image:

        (1) Create a blank project repository.
        (2) Create a blank text file named "Dockerfile" within this repository.
        (3) Within the Dockerfile, add the following clause: 

                FROM x684867/ubuntuElixir

            This line will allow the project to be build from the 
            base image while allowing the developer to customize the
            environment and add source code.
